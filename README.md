[Design freedom through flexible customization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_design#cite_note-2)

- **User-defined Customization**:
  The concept of user-defined customization emphasizes the flexibility and personalization of the component library. It empowers users to define and configure the styles and behaviors of components according to their specific needs.

  By offering customizable options and parameters, developers can create distinct components that align with their project requirements and design preferences. Users can easily adjust the appearance, layout, and interaction of components to meet their specific user experience needs and branding requirements.

  User-defined customization facilitates seamless integration of the component library with projects, providing an enhanced development experience and greater flexibility.

- **Community Collaboration**:
  The community plays a vital role in the continuous maintenance and expansion of Qionglou. It is the community that takes responsibility for maintaining the project and introducing new features.

  Within the community, there are dedicated roles for design and development, working together to shape the current state of Qionglou.

- **Thoughtful Design**:
  The principle of thoughtful design emphasizes the importance of well-crafted and user-friendly design to create an enjoyable development experience. It enables personalized customization that goes beyond simple color changes, leveraging the power of Canvas and SVG to achieve unique and fully customized components.

  By componentizing your design, complexity is transformed into simplicity, bringing richness and vibrancy to your projects.
